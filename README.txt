This plugin adds Tollbridge.co paywall integration to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plugin integrates Tollbridge.co paywall rules to an existing WordPress site.

== Installation ==

Activate the plugin. This will create a menu in the sidebar - "Tollbridge". Click into this menu, and enter the Tollbridge credentials from the admin panel in your Tollbridge account.

Paywall rules can be applied globally to all posts and pages, or applied individually per-post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have some articles behind the paywall and some free to access? =

Absolutely! There are two ways to achieve this, depending on how many articles you wish to make free:
* set the global paywall rules to restrict access, then on the articles you want free, override the paywall settings on those articles.
* set no global paywall rules (making the full site free to access), then set the paywall restrictions on articles you wish to limit.

= What about time-based access, e.g. "paywalled for a week, then free to access"? =

This can be managed in the global settings, selecting the "Change paywall access over time" section, and selecting the number of days after which access should change. This setting can also be set on a per-article level.

= Does this plugin support AMP? =

AMP pages are not currently supported by the Tollbridge platform.
